User Story 

As a product manager, I want a developer profile generator so that I can easily obtain and provide a resume on a specific developer. 

Usage 

At the start of the application, a prompt will appear to users that will have them enter a GitHub username and their favorite color.  When both prompts have been answered, the html and pdf file is generated and a confirmation message will appear.
